## What is `ftplugin`?

Although you probably already know how it works, [this little article](https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/using-ftplugin-in-vim) explains it very well.
For more information `:help ftplugin`.

## Why this is not written in Lua?

I would love to write this section in Lua, but it is not natively supported by NeoVim yet.
Although you can use plugin like [astronauta.nvim](https://github.com/tjdevries/astronauta.nvim), I think it is too much to install a plugin for something so simple.
I hope that in the future this option will be in the NeoVim core.
